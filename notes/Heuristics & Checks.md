To decide if **linear regression** is a suitable model for a regression task, you can follow a practical mix of **heuristics, visual checks, and statistical tests**. Here’s a clear guide rooted in established practice:

## 1. **Quick Heuristic Before Modeling**

- **Is your target variable continuous?** Linear regression works only for continuous outcomes, not for categories.[^1][^2]
- **Scatter Plot Check:** Plot your response (y) versus each predictor (x). If you observe a roughly straight-line relationship—with no clear curves or complex patterns—linear regression could be appropriate.[^3][^2]
- **Outliers \& Influential Points:** Look for extreme or influential outliers. If your data has many, linear regression may be unreliable without cleaning or transformation.[^2]
- **Feature Correlation:** For multiple regression, check correlations among predictors. If two or more are highly correlated (multicollinearity), interpretation becomes difficult.[^4][^3]


## 2. **Post-Model Diagnostic Tests (After Fitting the Model)**

Even if prechecks look good, you **must check these after fitting**:


| Assumption | What to Check | Test/Plot |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Linearity** | Relationship between x and y is linear | Plot residuals vs fitted values—look for random scatter not curves[^5][^6] |
| **Homoscedasticity** | Equal error spread at all value ranges | Scale-location (spread-location) plot—should see a cloud, not a “fan”[^7] |
| **Normality** | Errors follow a bell-curve | QQ plot of residuals—should fall on diagonal line[^7][^6] |
| **Independence** | Errors for each row are independent | Residuals vs observation/permutation order; Durbin-Watson test |
| **No multicollinearity** | Predictors are not highly correlated | Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) calculation |

See whether the **R²/Adjusted R²** is reasonable—high enough to describe meaningful variance, but not inflated by too many predictors.[^8][^3]

## 3. **Step-By-Step Decision Guide**

1. **Plot your data:** Is the relationship *visually* linear?
2. **Fit a simple linear regression model.**
3. **Check diagnostic plots** (residuals vs fitted, scale-location, QQ plot, residuals vs leverage).[^6][^7][^5]
4. **Assess numeric indicators:** R², Adjusted R², RMSE, MAE.[^3][^8]
5. **Look for failures:** If you see clear nonlinearity, heteroscedasticity, or non-normal residuals, ordinary linear regression may be unsuitable—consider transforming variables or using a more flexible model.

## 4. **Key Heuristics to Remember**

- *Start with linear regression if your data is simple, your predictors are continuous, and initial plots look linear.*[^9][^2]
- *If diagnostic plots show random residuals (no clear patterns), linear regression is likely a good fit.*[^7][^2]
- *For complex patterns or failures in residual plots, try polynomial regression, tree-based models, or other flexible approaches.*[^10][^2]


## 5. **Summary Checklist**

- [ ] Target variable is continuous
- [ ] Visual relationship appears linear
- [ ] No extreme outliers or influential points
- [ ] Predictors not highly correlated
- [ ] Diagnostic plots look healthy (see above)
- [ ] Error metrics (R², RMSE) are satisfactory

If you answer “yes” to most of these, linear regression is a good first candidate model. If not, consider alternatives or data transformation.

**Bottom line:**
There is no single foolproof test, but using a short series of visualizations, checks on assumptions, and simple heuristics will almost always guide you to the right modeling choice for your regression task.[^5][^9][^2][^6][^7][^3]
