You generally **cannot fully validate all the assumptions of linear regression before fitting a model**, because some assumptions (like those about the errors/residuals) can only be checked after you compute the model predictions. However, you can still do a few useful pre-modelling checks, and after fitting, you should always validate the assumptions carefully to judge if linear regression is appropriate for your dataset.

## Pre-modelling Checks

**1. Visualize Your Data**

- **Scatter plots:** Plot your target variable (y) versus each feature (x). If you see a roughly straight-line (linear) trend, linear regression may be appropriate.
- If the relationship is obviously curved, a straight line will not fit well, so linear regression isn’t a great choice without transforming the data.

**2. Check for Outliers and Influential Points**

- Outliers can affect linear models a lot, so spot any extreme, untypical points early.

**3. Feature Relationships (for multiple features)**

- Check if features are highly correlated with each other (multicollinearity). If you find strongly correlated pairs, linear regression might give unreliable results on those features.[^1]
- Remove or combine features, or reconsider including them.


## Core Assumptions (Validated After Fitting)

You assess these assumptions after fitting (i.e. after calculating predictions and residuals/errors):


| Assumption | What To Check (After Fitting) | Typical Diagnostics |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Linearity | Relationship between y and each x | Scatter plot, residuals vs. predicted values plot[^2] |
| Homoscedasticity | Residuals show equal spread | Residuals vs. predicted/fitted values plot[^2] |
| Normality | Residuals are distributed “bell-curve” | Histogram of residuals, normal probability plot |
| Independence | Residuals are not autocorrelated | Plot residuals in observation order, Durbin-Watson test[^1] |
| Multicollinearity | Predictors not highly correlated | Correlation matrix, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)[^1] |

## How Do You Know Linear Regression Is the “Right” Method?

- Use **simple plots** to look for a linear relationship and absence of obvious curvature or weird patterns.
- After fitting, if **diagnostic plots** (residuals vs. fitted values, histograms, Q-Q plots) do not show strong violations, linear regression is likely appropriate.
- If assumptions are *violated*:
    - Try transforming your features/target (log, square root, etc.).
    - Consider other regression methods (like polynomial regression, decision trees, or non-linear models) as appropriate.[^2][^1]

**Summary:**
Before modeling, you can get a sense of suitability by plotting data and inspecting features for correlation. However, the critical checks must be made after fitting the model—mainly by evaluating the residuals against the regression assumptions. If the model fails on key diagnostics, then linear regression probably isn’t the right tool, and you should consider alternatives or transform your variables for a better fit.[^1][^2]
